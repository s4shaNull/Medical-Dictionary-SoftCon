## Step 1: Virtualization
**Linux**: Does not required
**MacOS**: Does not required
**Windows**:
If you have already enabled WSL2 on your Windows machine, but haven't installed any Linux distro, I recommend go to [this link](https://ubuntu.com/wsl) to install Ubuntu on WSL.

It you haven't enabled WSL2. You must be running Windows 10 version 2004 and higher (Build 19041 and higher) or Windows 11 to use the commands below. Go to [this link](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) to figure out how to do this. Ubuntu should be automatically installed on your WSL after this.

## Step 2: Install Docker
**Linux/ WSL**: Go to [this link](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/)
**MacOS**: Go to [this link](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/)

## Step 3: Clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/s4shaNull/Medical-Dictionary-SoftCon
```
